    **Ranger.**  
    When you play Boromir (except in your starting fellowship), you may play a possession with a twilight cost of 1 or less on him from your draw deck. Reshuffle your draw deck.
  lore: Yes, there is weakness. There is frailty. But there is courage also, and honor to be found in Men.
