    **Ring-bound.** To play, add a burden.   
    Each time the fellowship moves, place an unbound companion in the dead pile.   
    **Regroup:** If Sméagol is the Ring-bearer, add 2 burdens to discard each minion. 
  lore: ‘…he used it to find out secrets, and he put his knowledge to crooked and malicious uses.’
