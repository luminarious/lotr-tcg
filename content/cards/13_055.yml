    **Ring-bound.** To play, add a burden.  
    For each card titled Déagol in your discard pile, Sméagol is strength +2 and resistance –1. Each time Sméagol wins a skirmish, you may take a :gollum: card from your draw deck and place it in your discard pile.
  lore: ‘…his head and his eyes were downward.’
