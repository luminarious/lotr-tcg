  subtitle: Thrall of The One
  text: |-
    **Enduring.**   
    Shadow cards cannot exert Úlairë Enquëa during a skirmish phase.   
    **Skirmish:** If Úlairë Enquëa is skirmishing, heal him to add a burden. 
  lore: Ever they circled above the City, like vultures that expect their fill of doomed men’s flesh.
