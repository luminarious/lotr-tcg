    Bearer must be a :men: minion.  
    Each time bearer wins a skirmish, you may transfer this possession to another :men: minion. If you do, stack a :men: minion from play on a :men: possession in your support area.
  lore: The men of Dunland took even the most basic of tools to be weapons against Rohan.
