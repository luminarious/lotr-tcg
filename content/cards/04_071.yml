  subtitle: Emissary of the Galadhrim
  text: |-
    While no opponent controls a site, Haldir is strength +2.   
    **Regroup:** Exert Haldir at a battleground and exert another Elf to liberate a site. 
  lore: ‘In days of old, my people stood beside the King of Gondor – we come to honor that allegiance.’
