    When you play this condition, you may add a :dwarven: token here. While you can spot 4 :dwarven: tokens and 2 Dwarves, each:orc:Orc gains this text "To play, remove an ¥ card from your discard pile from the game.”  
    **Skirmish:** Discard this condition to exert a minion for each Dwarf you can spot.
