  title: Grimbeorn
  subtitle: Beorning Chieftain
  text: |-
    At the start of each turn, heal Grimbeorn.  
    At the start of the maneuver phase, you may exert Grimbeorn twice and discard a minion from hand to make Grimbeorn strength +X until the regroup phase, where X is that minionâ€™s strength.
  lore: He was perhaps a shape-shifter like his father.
