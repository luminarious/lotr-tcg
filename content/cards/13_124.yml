  title: Éowyn
  subtitle: Restless Warrior
  text: |-
    Each possession you play on Éowyn during the fellowship phase is twilight cost –1.  
    Each time the fellowship moves during the regroup phase, you may reinforce a :rohan: token (or reinforce 2:rohan: tokens if you can spot Éomer or Théoden).
  lore: ‘Let her be as lord to the Eorlingas, while we are gone.’
