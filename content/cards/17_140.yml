  title: Úlairë Enquëa
  subtitle: Duplicitous Lieutenant
  text: |-
    **Fierce.** Each time the Free Peoples player heals a companion, you may add a burden.  
    **Maneuver:** Exert Úlairë Enquëa twice to discard a condition (or two conditions if you can spot 5 Free Peoples player’s conditions).
  lore: At all times they feel the presence of the ring.
