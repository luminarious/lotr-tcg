  title: Duinhir
  subtitle: Tall Man of Blackroot Vale
  text: |-
    While you can spot a mount, Duinhir is **damage +1**.  
    Each time Duinhir wins a skirmish, if you can spot more minions than companions, you may exert him to discard a minion that has strength 7 or less.
  lore: The garrison at Osgiliath fought valiantly.
