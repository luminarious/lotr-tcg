    While you can spot an :urukhai: minion, the Free Peoples player cannot replace a site.  
    At the start of each skirmish, you may remove :twilight3: to heal an :urukhai: minion (or heal an :urukhai: minion twice if you control a site.)
  lore: Though the arrows rained down, the Uruk formation did not break.
