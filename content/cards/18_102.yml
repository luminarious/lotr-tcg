    To play, spot Théoden.  
    **Skirmish:** Spot a :rohan: Man bearing a possession and discard a :rohan: possession from hand to make that Man strength +2.
  lore: With Gríma’s treacherous whispers removed and Saruman’s grasp released, none doubted the might and lordship of Théoden, the King of Rohan.
