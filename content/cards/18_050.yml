    **Tale.**  
    Each time a non-:wraith: minion is played, you may spot a Man to put a :gondor: token here.  
    **Maneuver:** Remove 3 :gondor: tokens from here to spot a minion. That minion cannot be assigned to a skirmish until the regroup phase.
  lore: Each turn was guarded by PÃºkel-men stones with their huge, clumsy arms folded across their round bellies.
