  subtitle: ''
  text: |-
    Each time a companion loses a skirmish involving an :urukhai: minion, place an :urukhai: token here.  
    **Skirmish:** Remove 2 :urukhai: tokens from here to take control of a site.
  lore: Over the wallâ€¦the last assault came sweeping like a dark wave upon a hill of sand.
