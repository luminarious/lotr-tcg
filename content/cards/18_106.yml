  title: A Dragon's Tale
  subtitle: ''
  text: |-
    **Tale.** To play, spot a Hobbit.  
    **Maneuver:** Discard a tale from play to choose a Shadow player who must exert one of his or her minions.
  lore: If you're referring to the incident with the dragon, I was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door.
