  title: Shagrat
  subtitle: Tower Captain
  text: |-
    **Damage +1. Hunter 1.** *(While skirmishing a non-hunter character, this character is strength +1.)*  
    While you can spot 7 possessions, Shagrat is **fierce** and cannot take wounds (except during skirmish phases).
  lore: I don't take orders from stinking Morgul rats!
